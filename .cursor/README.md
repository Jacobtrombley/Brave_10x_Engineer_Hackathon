# Cursor AI Configuration

This folder contains configuration settings and rules for Cursor AI's behavior within the Job Matching Recommendation System project.

## Folder Structure

- **settings.json**: Global AI behavior configuration for the entire project
- **rules/**: Directory containing specialized rule sets for different components
  - **ui.json**: Rules for UI components and styling
  - **models.json**: Rules for machine learning models and algorithms
  - **data.json**: Rules for data pipelines and processing

## Purpose of Project Rules

Project rules in Cursor AI enable granular control over AI behavior within different parts of a codebase. These rules help maintain consistency, enforce best practices, and customize AI assistance based on specific requirements of different components.

## How Rules Are Applied

1. Rules are matched based on file patterns specified in each rule set
2. More specific patterns take precedence over general patterns
3. When working in a file, Cursor AI applies the most relevant rules based on the file path
4. Global rules from `settings.json` apply to all files unless overridden by specific rules

## Rules Configuration

Each rule set contains:

- **name**: Descriptive name for the rule set
- **description**: Purpose of the rules
- **include**: File patterns where rules should be applied
- **rules**: Array of specific rules with:
  - **description**: What the rule is for
  - **pattern**: Specific file pattern for the rule
  - **ai**: AI behavior configuration
    - **allow**: Permitted AI operations
    - **guidelines**: Specific instructions for AI when working with matching files

## AI-Assisted Development

Throughout this project, we leveraged Cursor's AI capabilities to enhance development efficiency and quality. Here's how Cursor AI was utilized:

### Code Generation and Enhancement

- **UI Development**: Used AI to generate HTML/CSS components for the job seeker and employer dashboards
- **Chatbot Implementation**: AI assistance in designing the conversational interfaces and response generation logic
- **Visualization Components**: Helped create data visualization elements for the analytics sections

### Code Refactoring

- Improved code organization in several key components
- Enhanced the styling system for better maintainability
- Optimized JavaScript functions for better performance

### Bug Resolution

- Identified and fixed issues in chat message handling
- Resolved styling inconsistencies across different UI components
- Fixed server port handling issues for local development

### Feature Implementation

- **Enhanced Candidate Display**: AI helped implement the card-based candidate profile display with detailed information
- **Improved Chat UX**: Enhanced the chatbot's ability to handle specific user queries about candidates
- **Visual Styling**: Improved the visual presentation of chat messages and candidate information

## Development Process

The AI-assisted development workflow typically followed these steps:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Basic structure and functionality created
2. **AI Enhancement**: Cursor AI suggestions used to improve code quality and add features
3. **Testing & Refinement**: Manual testing followed by AI-assisted refinement
4. **Documentation**: AI helped document the changes and features

## Examples of AI Contributions

### Chatbot Response Handling Enhancement

The AI significantly improved the chatbot's ability to handle specific types of queries by:

- Adding a more comprehensive keyword matching system
- Creating a detailed candidate database with structured information
- Implementing specialized response templates for different query types
- Adding visual styling to make responses more readable and informative

### UI Component Styling

Cursor AI helped develop a consistent styling system across components by:

- Creating card-based layouts for candidate information
- Implementing a tag system for displaying skills and attributes
- Adding visual hierarchy to information display
- Ensuring responsive design principles were followed

## Technical Decisions Guided by AI

The AI provided valuable insights that influenced several technical decisions:

1. Using a component-based architecture for UI elements
2. Implementing a two-stage matching algorithm for better accuracy
3. Adding detailed candidate cards with skill tags for better UX
4. Using structured data models for candidate information

This documentation highlights how Cursor AI served as a development partner throughout the project, enhancing both the development process and the final product quality.
